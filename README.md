CS 342 - Project 1

This project showcases a custom hash map implementation I created in Java, along with a set of flexible data structures and tools that all work together seamlessly. At the heart of it is the hash map, which I built from the ground up to ensure near-constant-time lookups for inserting, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs. To make it more versatile, I also implemented a generic list, a queue, and some specialized iterators (including one that goes in reverse) so I can easily navigate and manipulate data in different ways.

I put a lot of effort into testing, using JUnit to cover both typical operations and tricky edge cases, making sure the map and the supporting structures are solid and dependable. Using Maven as the projectâ€™s backbone makes the layout and dependency management straightforward, and keeps the build process nice and clean.
